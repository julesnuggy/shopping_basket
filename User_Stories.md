We would like you to re-create the following basket:

Here are some rough user stories for you to work to:

*Basket-001*  
**As a** user  
**I want** to view my current basket  
**So that** I can see what I've added  

**Given** I am on the basket page  
**When** I view the page  
**Then** I can see all added items and their cost  

*Basket-002*  
**As a** user  
**I want** to change the quantity of a basket item  
**So that** I can decide item totals before purchasing  

**Given** I am on the basket page  
**When** I view the page  
**Then** I can see an item quantity next to each item  

**Given** I am on the basket page  
**When** I view the page  
**Then** I can see each item's total cost (adjusted for quantity)  

**Given** I am on the basket page  
**When** I change an item quantity  
**Then** the item's total cost is adjusted, in real-time  

*Basket-003*  
**As a** user  
**I want** to view my current basket total  
**So that** I can see what I'm going to have to pay  

**Given** I am on the basket page  
**When** I view the page  
**Then** I can see a total cost, accounting for all items and quantities  

*Basket-004*  
**As a** user  
**I want** to remove all items from my basket  
**So that** I can start over  

**Given** I am on the basket page  
**When** I click the "clear" button  
**Then** all items are reset to zero (but remain in the basket)
